# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis.
 The following project is a website that countains data of UFO sightings in a specific date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. The website is stylized in a dark color, with breif summary of the webiste, a layout of the data that can be seen, and also having a filter option to show on which data point you wish to see. The website uses the data.js which is a JavaScript langauge which was provided for the data needed for the UFO sightings which included the date, city, country, etc. The next file was the app.js, this file also uses JavaScript which allows us to create a table for the website and create the button to filter the table and also clear out the filter. There is also a CSS file to which is called style, which helps with creating the dark theme and also for adding the nasa.jpg image that was used in our html code. Which is the next file that was created the index.html file which is the website itself. This is the file that lets us see the website itself and orginize how the layout of the content will look.
